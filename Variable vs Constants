#This is a comment
#Variables vs Constants 
#Variables are declared in titlecase
#CONSTANTS are declared in CAPITALS 

#Example of variable

Team1Name = " DS machine"
Team2Name = "Croydon warriors"

#Variables have a useful name 
#Variables store a value (can change)
#Variable can NOT start with a number
#e.g. 1TeamName = "Croydon warriors"
#This will cause a syntax error

#Variables can not have a space in the name
#e.g. Team Name = "Croydon warriors"
#This will be a syntax error 

#This is an example of a CONSTANT
FREETHROW = 1
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3

#The values in a CONSTANT do NOT change
